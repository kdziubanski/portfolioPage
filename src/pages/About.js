          Hi my name is Krzysztof Dziuba≈Ñski. I am master of Accademy of
          Phisical Education. I have started my journey with coding one year
          ago. After few lines of code I found out that this is the way where i
          want to go. I started with HTML and CSS learning from online courses,
          after some basic projects I wanted more. Then I putted my hands to
          JavaScript and React. Right now I am working with React. In the coming
          months I will learn React Native, Node.js, MongoDB and Express. I
          decided that this is the moment where I want to change my career path
          and become full time developer.
